## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

Financial institutions face a trilemma in payment processing: the need for speed, ironclad security, and rigorous compliance. Existing solutions are often fragmented, leading to operational inefficiencies, reactive fraud management, and difficulty adapting to new regulatory demands. When a payment fails or is flagged for fraud, it is often difficult to determine the precise point of failure or to proactively identify systemic issues. There is a market need for a unified platform that not only processes payments efficiently but also provides extreme visibility and predictive insights into the health and security of the payment ecosystem.

This document outlines the requirements for the **CorePay AI-Powered Digital Twin Platform**, a next-generation payment orchestration solution that leverages a high-fidelity, real-time simulation layer to deliver unparalleled fraud detection, automated compliance, and system-wide observability.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

The primary goal is to build a robust backend platform that can be integrated by banks and large financial institutions to enhance their payment processing capabilities.

## 3. Personas

*   **Clara - The Compliance Officer:** Clara needs to ensure the bank adheres to all regulations. She needs automated, auditable proof that every transaction is screened. She is frustrated by manual reviews and the slow process of generating reports.
*   **Frank - The Fraud Analyst:** Frank is responsible for investigating suspicious transactions. He is constantly fighting new, sophisticated fraud schemes and needs tools that can predict risk in real-time and explain *why* a transaction is considered risky.
*   **Devin - The DevOps Engineer:** Devin is responsible for integrating new services with the bank's core infrastructure. He needs a solution with clear, secure, and reliable APIs. He is concerned with system uptime, scalability, and minimizing disruption during integration.

## 4. Features & Scope

The platform is a microservices-based system orchestrated via a Kafka event stream. The core innovation is the **Parallel Run Architecture**, which processes every transaction through both a Live Path and a Simulation Path.

### 4.1. Transaction Ingestion & Event Streaming
*   **FEAT-01: Transaction Ingestion Service:** A secure endpoint (REST API) to accept incoming payment requests from the client's systems.
*   **FEAT-02: Kafka Event Backbone:** All incoming transactions are published as events to a central Kafka stream, enabling asynchronous processing.

### 4.2. The AI Engine: Multi-Model Pipeline
A sequence of specialized AI models that subscribe to Kafka topics to enrich and analyze transaction events.
*   **FEAT-03: Data Enrichment Model:** Validates and enriches transaction data with contextual information (e.g., Geo-IP, device intelligence).
*   **FEAT-04: Automated Compliance Model:** Screens transactions against AML/KYC watchlists and flags them based on regulatory rulesets.
*   **FEAT-05: Behavioral & Anomaly Models:** Score the transaction based on behavioral biometrics and deviation from historical patterns for the user and their peer group.
*   **FEAT-06: Risk & Routing Decision Engine:** A final model that synthesizes all prior scores, generates a final decision (`APPROVE`, `DENY`, `CHALLENGE`), and produces an explainable AI output (e.g., "Reason: Unusual cross-border transaction").

### 4.3. The Digital Twin & Simulation Layer
*   **FEAT-07: Digital Twin Data Store:** Each customer/entity will have a Digital Twin represented as a flexible document in Couchbase. This twin stores historical transactions, behavioral baselines, and risk profiles, and is continuously updated by the AI Engine.
*   **FEAT-08: Parallel Run Architecture:** For every incoming transaction, the system will execute two parallel workflows:
    *   **Live Path:** Interacts with real-world payment gateways and ledgers to process the actual payment.
    *   **Simulation Path:** A high-fidelity execution layer that uses virtualized mocks of payment gateways and ledgers to simulate the transaction outcome. The state of this simulation is stored in the Digital Twin.
*   **FEAT-09: Divergence Detector:** A critical service that compares the final outcome of the Live Path with the outcome of the Simulation Path. If a mismatch occurs, it generates a `divergence_alert` for immediate investigation.

### 4.4. Integration & API
*   **FEAT-10: Secure API Gateway:** A single, secure entry point for banks to initiate transactions and query status.
*   **FEAT-11: Asynchronous Notifications:** The platform will use Webhooks and/or dedicated Kafka topics to push final outcomes and divergence alerts back to the bank's systems.

## 5. User Flow: A Single Transaction's Journey

1.  A bank's mobile app sends a payment request to the CorePay API Gateway.
2.  The Ingestion Service publishes a `raw_transaction` event to Kafka.
3.  The event is picked up by **both the Live Path and the Simulation Path** simultaneously.
4.  **In the Live Path:** The AI Engine analyzes the transaction, provides a score, and approves it. The request is sent to the real Visa network. Visa returns `Success`. The outcome is published to the `live_outcome` topic.
5.  **In the Simulation Path:** The same AI Engine analyzes the transaction and approves it. The request is sent to the *mock* Visa network. The mock, based on its programming, also returns `Success`. The outcome is published to the `simulation_outcome` topic.
6.  The **Divergence Detector** receives both events, sees the outcomes match, and takes no action. The transaction is successful and consistent.
7.  **Divergence Scenario:** Imagine the real Visa network was down. The Live Path would return `FAILED`, while the Simulation Path would still return `SUCCESS`. The Divergence Detector would immediately flag this mismatch and fire an alert, allowing the bank's operations team to investigate the issue with Visa long before customers report it.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Security:** End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest. Secure API authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0).
*   **Performance:** P99 latency for the AI Decision Engine must be < 150ms. The platform must handle a baseline of 1,000 transactions per second.
*   **Scalability:** All microservices must be containerized (Docker) and horizontally scalable.
*   **Reliability:** The platform must have an uptime of 99.99%. This includes automated failover for all critical components.
*   **Auditability & Explainability:** All decisions made by the AI Engine must be logged with an "explainability" payload for regulatory review. All actions are immutable and tracked in an audit log.
*   **Data Privacy:** The system must be compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data privacy regulations.

## 7. Out of Scope for MVP

*   **User-Facing Dashboard:** A comprehensive UI for visualizing transactions, managing rules, and analyzing divergence alerts is a critical fast-follow but is not part of this core backend MVP.
*   **Interactive "What-If" Scenarios:** A UI for manually creating and testing hypothetical scenarios in the simulation layer.
*   **Customer-Facing Communication:** The platform will not handle sending emails or SMS messages to the end-users (e.g., transaction receipts). This remains the responsibility of the integrating bank.
